# homebridge-rcswitch-pulselength

The plugin is based on the idea of [FWeinb's rcswitch](https://github.com/FWeinb/homebridge-rcswitch) plugin.
It is written by Christopher Neuwirth, who named it Homebridge RC433 Etekcity plugin (https://github.com/ChristopherNeuwirth/homebridge-rc433-etekcity).
I bought switches at TOOM and they are manufactured by RWE. Normal rcswitch services were not working or
not working properly. The pulse length had to be set between 250 and 300 microsec. 350 or higher is not working with these RWE switches.
Now the Etekcity plugin sets the pulse length originally to 188 microsec, which is too short, but as seen in issue no1
the original should let specify a pulse length in the configuration file, but is not using this parameter.
*Now you can change the pulse length as well as the RF pin for each switch.*

# Installation

1. Install [WiringPi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/)
2. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
3. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-rcswitch-pulselength`
4. Update your configuration file.

# Configuration

You can add as many switches as you like. You will need to pass the `name`,
`id`=unitcode, `pulse` length, `pin` GIO pin of RF module (usual 0),
the `on` and `off` code as decimal string
as received by e.g. RFSniffer in the 433Utils.

 ```
 "accessories": [
     {
         "accessory": "RCSwitchP",
         "name": "Switch One",
         "id": "01",
         "pulse": "250",
         "pin": "0",
         "on": "5566771",
         "off": "5577660"
     }
]
```
# Remarks

I added the pulselength feature into this easygoing plugin, because I bought switches at TOOM and they are manufactured by RWE.
These switches have a normal 1..5 and A..E coding, but were not switchable by rcswitch programm.
But I was able to switch my Brenstuhl switches with the remote of RWE (after coding), but not vice versa.
So I tried the platform-rcswitch, but this caused troulbe on my PI3.
(after changing the config, a restart of the homebridge is not enough, the Pi had to be restarted).
Nevertheless, it was possible to switch both types using a pulselength of 250 to 300 ï¿½s.
In the original homebridge-rcswitch it was not implemented to configure the pulselength.
